# Gold Price Whatsapp Bot

Simple bot that sends me the gold prices for the day.

### How it works ?
Using selenium and Java, scraped a website that has the gold prices for the day and use that data and format them correctly and send to my personal WhatsApp. I can add additional contacts if I would want to send them this info as well.

If you like to schedule this task, you can make a .bat file use a Task Scheduler to run it daily on Windows. Or you can schedule it as a cronjob in Linux.
